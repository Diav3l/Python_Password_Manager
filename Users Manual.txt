Main:
    Methods in main take user input and translate them for use in the backend classes
    Many methods in main do not require user input in the signature because it takes them in the method body

    generate_password(string: str) -> str:
        Handles user input to create a unique password given user criteria
        :returns str

    update_noise():
            This method creates noise files with the same date and time as user files
        This method is a security measure that stops attackers from identifying the file that contains the users passwords.
        This file updates the datetime modified attribute of all files to be exactly the same, while the datetime created
        cannot be change noise files are created at the same time as user files, so they should already be identical.
        This prevents someone with access to the source files from identifying user created files.

    add_entry() -> None:
        Encrypts and adds new entry to users file

    delete_entry() -> None:
        Deletes line from user file

    print_all_entries() -> None:
        Decrypts and prints all user entries to the console

    verify_login() -> bool:
        Verifies that user provided the correct password

    change_password() -> None:
            Changes the users password for encryption and decryption
        This method requires that the whole file be decrypted with the old key and re-encrypted with the new key.
        This means that for a very short amount of time the users file exists as plaintext in RAM, the variable containing
        the plaintext entries is deleted at the end of the method, and the user is logged out

    delete_account():
        Deletes account file
        This is not yet implemented

    main():
        Handles user input and points to other methods as requested by the user

Encryption:
    uses variable ROT encryption and alphabet rotation derived from sha3_512 hashing and stacking the users password

    __init__(self, hashedPassword):
            Generates a unique character list used for encryption based on the given string
        This means that the users password is the encryption and decryption key, therefore it is incredibly important
        that it is safeguarded because a lost password is a lost account and no recovery options are possible.

    encrypt(self, string: str) -> str:
        converts plaintext to ciphertext
        :returns ciphertext: str

    decrypt(self, string: str) -> str:
        Converts ciphertext of given plaintext
        :returns plaintext: str

    @staticmethod
    generate(length=30, special_characters=True) -> str:
        Generates a unique password using pythons secrets librairy
        :param length: int, defaults to 30
        :param special_characters: bool, defaults to True
        :return password: str, of requested length and character usage

    @staticmethod
    stack(hashed_string: hashlib.sha3_512) -> hashlib.sha3_512:
        Stacks the given string in a sha3_512 hash 1 million times
        :return hashed_string: _Hash

    @staticmethod
    generate_noise_file(number_of_files: int) -> None:
        Creates files of random length with noise that looks the same as actual user data
        :param number_of_files: int

NoiseFile:
     Class that is used to generate noise files

    This class is standalone to prevent circular imports of Encryption and File

    @staticmethod
    generate_noise_file(number_of_files =secrets.randbelow(11) + 40) -> None:
        Creates files of random length with noise that looks the same as actual user data
        :param number_of_files: int, default secrets.randbelow(11)+40

File:
    File handler class

    __init__(self, pointer: str, verify_hash: str, user_file = False):
        Creates file if it does not exist and add the users verify_hash at the top of the file

        This is used to create all files. If instantiation is tagged as a user file it creates noise files around the
        user file so that the user file is guaranteed to share a creation time with noise files. This prevents easy
        identification of user files. A random number of noise files are created on each side of the user file. This
        means that even after a user deletes their file the noise files still appear the same as user info, and
        contribute to security.
        :param pointer: str, is the filename
        :param verify_hash: str, is the first line of file
        :param user_file = False, if True creates noise file

        *The imports for Encryption and secrets are inside an if statement within the method. This is an intentional
        decision because the vast majority of the time that the File class is instantiated these imports are not used.
        importing these when unneeded slows down the creation of noise files meaning that fewer files share a creation
        time with user data. Therefore, the imports are conditional, under any other circumstances this would be a bad
        practice.

    append_file(self, passwordEntry: str) -> None:
        Adds entry to the bottom of the file
        :param passwordEntry: str

    write_file(self, strings: list[str]) -> None:
        Replaces content of file with contents of given array
        :param strings: list[str]

    to_array(self) -> list[str]:
        Copies the entire file to an array
        :return list[str] of every line in the file, removes new line characters

    delete_line(self, line_to_remove: int) -> None:
        Deletes given line in range [1,âˆž)
        :param line_to_remove: int

    delete_file(self) -> None:
        Deletes file
